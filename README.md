Lightweight web app that gives an audio notification when items change during an iBood hunt.

run the server by executing "node src/server.js" in the root directory and browse to localhost:3000.

Tests are written in Jasmine and run with Karma, to run them execute "karma start" in the root directory.

Happy hunting!
